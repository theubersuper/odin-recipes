# odin-recipes
2nd GitHub repo for TOP

PROJECT TO-DO as of 6.13.22:

Per item #4 of setting up project repo, in your README.md file: 
Write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
