# odin-recipes

2nd GitHub repo for The Odin Project

This is The Odin Project's first project, and the final part of their HTML Foundations module.

It is designed to showcase my newly-acquired skills of building a functioning "recipes" website: a homepage with links to three identically-structured recipe webpages, and it's been a great working introduction to version control by way of the use of Git and GitHub.

Although the styling is to be later added to these pages with CSS, the recipe pages actually look quite good right now in a clean, minimalistic way thanks to my design choices in structuring the content, using appropriate heading sizes, and including appetizing, properly-sized JPG images.
