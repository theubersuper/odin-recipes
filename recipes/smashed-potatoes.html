    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These easy-to-prepare, restaurant-style potatoes pair well with grilled steak or roasted chicken thighs. Their crispy yet creamy texture makes potato-lovers rejoice!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1lb) bag small Dutch Yellow potatoes, or small Yukon Gold potatoes, or small red potatoes (they're all good)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>A light sprinkling of ground cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and boil until fork tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Place potatoes onto a cutting board then gently smash (you can use the base of a heavy glass measuring cup, but some people use their fist. Fun!) until each potato reaches about half its thickness, being careful to keep the potato intact. </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Drizzle about 2 tablespoons of olive oil onto a baking tray, then gently transfer each smashed potato onto the baking tray with a spatula. Generously brush the remaining olive oil atop the potatoes then sprinkle with salt and pepper (and for some optional zip, some ground cayenne pepper). Place tray of potatoes in the heated oven and bake for 15 minutes. Flip the potatoes, season with salt and pepper and bake an additional 10 minutes until the tops are golden brown and crispy. Serve immediately.</p>
