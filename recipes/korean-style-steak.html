  <h1>Grilled, Korean-Style Steaks with Spicy Cilantro Sauce</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a fantastic, savory recipe that will easily become a "flavorite" in your culinary portfolio. It not only produces some of the best steak you'll ever eat, but the marinade and sauce adapt well to other meats such as chicken (boneless thighs are amazing). The cut of beef known as tri-tip pairs especially well with this recipe, so much so that some people refer to it as "Korean Tri-tip." A bonus is knowing that the reduced marinade can be used as a delicious sauce all by itself for those who prefer to forego the cilantro sauce. However, many people prepare and use both!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup medium-dry Sherry</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon Asian sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>6 (1-inch-thick) boneless beef top loin (strip) steaks, about 3/4 lb each</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (including roots and stems)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced seeded fresh habanero or serrano chile (optional)</li>
        <li>1 (4-inch-long) fresh hot red chile, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Stir together 3/4 cup soy sauce, Sherry, sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and red pepper ï¬‚akes in a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking dish until sugar is
        dissolved, then add steaks, turning to coat. Marinate steaks, turning once, 1 hour.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Prepare grill for cooking.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Stir together cilantro, vegetable oil, lime juice, remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, remaining 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and chile if using.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>When grill is medium-hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack 3 to 4 seconds), grill steaks on a lightly oiled rack 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Let steaks
            stand on a cutting board 5 minutes, then top with some sauce and cut crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick slices.</p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Serve remaining sauce on the side.</p>
